# ApplangaSPM

This is a repo containing a Swift package wrapped around the Applanga iOS SDK (in the form of an XCFramework).

This currently only works with Xcode 12 beta

### This is currently a beta release and will be fully tested and ready for production by the time Xcode 12 is out of beta

## Instilation instructions

To install, in Xcode go to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependancy

Then enter the URL from this repo: https://github.com/applanga/ApplangaSPM

And select the master branch as the source. (We will soon switch to releases as the source)

Then continue to use the sdk as in the normal ios documentation

For documentation regarding the normal applanga ios sdk, please go to: https://www.applanga.com/docs/integration-documentation/ios
